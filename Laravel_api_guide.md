## 1. **Introduction**
This document outlines the guidelines for designing and implementing APIs in Laravel applications. Following these standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across all API endpoints.

## 15. **Coding and Technical Guidelines**

### **Code Structure and Organization**
- Follow Laravel's default directory structure for controllers, models, services, and routes.
- Use dedicated service classes for business logic and avoid placing logic directly in controllers.
- Use resource controllers and route model binding where applicable.

### **Controller Guidelines**
- Keep controllers thin and delegate business logic to service classes.
- Use meaningful method names such as `index`, `store`, `update`, `destroy`, and `show`.
- Ensure that each controller method corresponds to a single responsibility.

### **Model Guidelines**
- Use Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
- Define relationships, accessors, and mutators within models.
- Use mass assignment protection with `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties.

### **Service and Repository Layer**
- Implement service classes for complex business logic.
- Use repository classes to abstract database interactions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

### **Middleware**
- Use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and input validation.
- Keep middleware focused on a single responsibility.

### **Validation**
- Use Laravel Form Requests to validate incoming requests.
- Keep validation logic separate from controllers.

### **Routing**
- Define routes in `routes/api.php`.
- Group routes by functionality and apply middleware appropriately.

### **API Resource Classes**
- Use API Resource classes to transform Eloquent models into JSON responses.
- Maintain consistency in API responses.

### **Caching**
- Use caching to optimize performance for frequently accessed endpoints.
- Store cache keys in a structured format, such as `store:list` or `store:{id}`.

### **Performance Optimization**
- Use eager loading to reduce the number of database queries.
- Optimize database indexes and use pagination for large datasets.

### **Error Logging and Monitoring**
- Log errors using Laravelâ€™s built-in logging system.
- Capture and monitor logs using tools like Laravel Telescope, Sentry, or external services.

### **Environment Configuration**
- Store environment-specific configurations in `.env` files.
- Never commit sensitive information or environment files to version control.

### **Deployment and CI/CD**
- Automate deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
- Use tools like Laravel Forge, Envoyer, or GitHub Actions for deployment.

### **Code Quality**
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Use tools like PHPStan, PHPCS, or Laravel Pint to ensure code quality.

### **Version Control**
- Use Git for version control.
- Follow best practices for branching, commit messages, and code reviews.

### âœ… **Conclusion**
Following these coding and technical guidelines ensures that your Laravel APIs are efficient, maintainable, and scalable. Always strive for clean, well-documented, and testable code.
